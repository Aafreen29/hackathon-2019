# Areas where we could improve
* Post event questionnaire could be more targetted
* Cummulative voting could be automated
* Name tags made up before the event
* Stressful having the judges go around during the event
* AWS Tutorial could have used more time
* A tutorial on how to work collaboratively
* Food
    * Ordered 4 salad's but 2 was enough
    * Pretzels were not too popular
    * Vegatarian food for all meals could be better
    * Hot Chocolate and tea was not too popular
    * More variety of fruit (we had apples and oranges)
* Facilities
    * UCI WiFi was blocking access to EC2 instances on AWS
* Communication
    * Clearer instructions on how to pay for parking at UCI
        * Pay kiosk and directions for operating the kiosk to get the full day permit.  1) Press yellow button #4 for "more options" 2) Press yellow button #1 for general full-day permit
    * The README.md was a bit overwhelming
    * It was not clear what they needed to do with the data
    * 6 hours to register from the waitlist is too short
