## Facility Notes

* Trash pick-ups will be at 1pm on Saturday and 7am and 1pm on Sunday.
* HVAC is scheduled from 8am - midnight on Saturday and 8am - 8pm on Sunday.
* The building will lock on its own on Saturday evening at 10pm so attendees won't be able to come and go after this time.
* There are no facilities staff during the weekend, thus tables and chairs cannot be added to the terrace. A workaround is to bring out the two six-foot tables under the stairwell on the third floor for the food. There is about 20 â€“ 25 seats on the terrace. The rest of the attendees can eat in our courtyard which is also a very nice area! In terms of food set up for other parts of the day, I suggest our first floor.
