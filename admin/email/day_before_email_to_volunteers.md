# [OCRUG] Hackathon Volunteers

Dear Volunteers:

Please make sure that you are familiar with the [event schedule](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019). 
If are helping with operational tasks please check out the [facilities notes](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/admin/facilities.md) 
and the [volunteer schedule](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/admin/volunteer_schedule.md) so that you know when and what you are 
supposed to do. If you are judging, please arrive at least 30-min before the start time of the presentations and be 
familiar with the [judging guidelines](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/admin/judging_guidelines.md).

Thank you all for your help, it is greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

John
