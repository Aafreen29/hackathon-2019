# OCRUG 2019 Hackathon Preparation

## Pre-hackathon Setup

To make the most of your time, there are a number of things that you should do to prepare for the event.

1. Carefully read the [README](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/README.md) file for the event.
1. OCRUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment. Please read and abide by the [OCRUG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
1. Information for the hackathon is kept in the [hackathon-2019 GitHub repo](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019). If you do not have a GitHub account, please [create one](https://github.com/join).
1. You will need to install **git** to *clone* the repo. For instructions on doing this on Windows, we have created a [guide](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/setup/git%20for%20Windows/git%20for%20Windows.pdf) or you can use [this tutorial](https://www.onlinetutorialspoint.com/git/how-to-install-git-windows-10-operating-system.html). On Windows 10 you can also install it in the Ubuntu console. For the MacOS [download the installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).
1. Once you have git installed, you will need to clone the repo with the command: **git clone git@github.com:ocrug/hackathon-2019.git**
1. One of the tutorials will teach you how to run RStudio on AWS. This will give you the option to use larger machines to do your work. You can also use EMR (Spark / Hadoop) with R if you wish. There will be AWS credits that should cover the costs for most people. You can set up an account and the credits can be applied retroactively to the beginning of the billing cycle (i.e. the start of the month). [Create an AWS Account and IAM user](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/setup/Create%20AWS%20Account%20and%20IAM%20user/Create%20an%20aws%20account%20and%20an%20IAM%20user.pdf). If you plan to use your computer then this is optional.
1. We will be using [slack.com](https://slack.com/) during the event. If you are not on the [OCRUG Slack channel](https://ocrug.slack.com) please [sign-up](https://ocrug-slack.herokuapp.com/). 
1. Join the **hackathon-2019** channel in slack. This is a great place to get help in getting set-up for the hackathon.
1. We have created the script [check_setup.r](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/check_setup.r). You can run to make sure that you have the basic libraries installed and updated software.

## Other Details

1. The event will be held at the Paul Merage School of Business at UC Irvine in building SB1. See the [parking instructions](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) and how to locate SB1.
1. This hackathon is a team event. You may want to form teams before the event. If you do not have a team, we will help organize teams at the start of the hackathon.
1. Registration will be between 8:30 and 9:00 on Saturday, May 18th. The tutorials will start at 9:00. These are optional.
1. At 1:00 PM the data will be released and there will be a presentation that will provide an overview.
1. Any person that is not registered by 1:00 PM on Saturday will be considered a 'no-show' and their spot may be given to someone else. 
1. If you are not able to attend, please let us know ASAP. We have over 50 people on the waiting list.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there
