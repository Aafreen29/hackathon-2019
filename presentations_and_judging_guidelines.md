# Competition Awards and Judging Guidelines

## Overview

On Sunday afternoon, all teams will prepare and present a final presentation covering their work during the hackathon, highlighting the insights and conclusions they found within the data set.  The presentations will be presented to a panel of judges who will then award prizes in three categories:

* Best Insight
* Best Visualization
* Best Model

All teams that present will be eligible for the *Best Insight* award.  Any team that presents a visualization and/or modeling results will also be eligible for the *Best Visualization* and *Best Model* awards.  Though visualizations in particular are highly encouraged for all presentations, teams are not required to use either visualizations or models in their presentations.

## Presentations
All teams will need to make a presentation covering their work during the hackathon, highlighting the *insights*, *visualizations* and/or *models* they developed during the event.  

* Each team should prepare a PDF version of their presentation, produced with any software package (e.g. PowerPoint, Keynote, Shiny RMarkdown, etc.)
* Presentations must be submitted by 2 PM on Sunday. Submission details will be covered at the hackathon.
* Each team will have 5 minutes to present.  Due to the number of teams that will present and time restrictions, presentations will be stopped promptly at 5 minutes.
* There is no specific limit to the number of pages/slides for presentations as long as the presentation can fit within the 5 minute time limit.
* Each team will present from a team member’s laptop to the main projector screen in the presentation room.
* Teams that use interactive visualizations should embed a screenshot of the visualization in their PDF presentation, and show the actual visualization during the presentation.

Tips for presentations:

* We will have 1 hour set aside specifically for preparing presentations after lunch on Sunday, from 1 — 2PM.
* However, be thinking about your presentation throughout the event and start preparations early.
* Simple and clear presentations are often more effective than more complex presentations.
* Teams only have 5 minutes to present so strive to present a clear message that can be delivered within the time limit.  This likely translates to presentations with 2 or 3 slides.
* Decide in advance which laptop your team will be present from.
* Decide in advance who will speak during the presentation.
* Practice your presentation at least one time to get a feel for timing and content.


## Judging Guidelines

### Best Insight
* All teams that present their work will be eligible for the *Best Insight* award.
* An *insight* will be considered as piece of “knowledge” gained through the analysis of the hackathon data set.  This could include, for example:
	* an interesting conclusion or understanding about the data
	* a recommendation or suggestion about how something could be changed or done differently, supported by data analysis
	* a link or association between information in the data, particularly ones that are unexpected or non-intuitive
* Insights will be judged based upon how much practical impact the insight could have on the subject of the hackathon data set, and how well the associated analysis supports it.

### Best Visualization
* Any team that presents a visualization as part of their final submission is eligible for the *Best Visualization* award.
* Visualizations can be either static graphics (e.g. a plot or 2-D graphic), or an interactive/dynamic visualization (e.g. a web page or a Shiny application with graphics components).
* Visualizations will be judged primarily on their ability to clearly convey an interesting and/or insightful aspect of the hackathon data set.  Factors include:
	* how the data is used to communicate interesting aspects of the data in visual form
	* the ability for someone not familiar with the data to understand (with the accompanying presentation) the main points of the visualization
	* the effective use of data graphics principles including, for example, the use of statistical summarizations, color, data subsetting, data highlighting, etc.
	* For static graphics, overly complex visualizations that detract from understanding the points of the visualization should be avoided.
	* for interactive/dynamic graphics, the interactive aspect should be a fundamental component to understanding the points of the visualization.  Interactivity for interactivity-sake should be avoided.
	* interactive graphics will not be judged as “better” than static graphics simply because they are interactive.

### Best Model
* Any team that presents results of their work that were obtained using statistical modeling will be eligible for the *Best Model* award.
* Any data modeling method can be used, including:
	* Linear regression, logistic regression, and other common statistical models
	* Machine learning models and algorithms such as decisions trees, Random Forest, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks
* Teams presenting modeling results should also report an assessment of model performance (e.g. RMSE, confusion matrices/TPR/FPR/accuracy, ROC AUC, etc). 
* Models will be judged based the underlying question the model is trying to address, the interpretation of the results, the performance of the model, and the validity of the methods used to derive the model.

### Most Helpful Person

* In addition to the team presentations, the *Most Helpful Person* award will be awarded to the most helpful person at the event, as voted upon by the hackathon participants.
* Before lunch on Sunday, participants will vote for the most helpful person via a Shiny applications.  The person with the most votes will recieve the *Most Helpful Person* award.
