# OCRUG Hackathon 2019

## Event Summary

The OCRUG Hackathon 2019, hosted by the [Orange County R Users Group](https://ocrug.org) and the [UCI Paul Merage School of Business](https://merage.uci.edu) is a two day event where we will "hack" a data set for fun, education, and prizes.  The focus of the event is on education and teamwork, with the main goal of taking a data set from its "raw" form all the way through to a final "product" (e.g. visualization, model, insight).  To frame this process, we will have light competitive aspect where teams will present their work at end of the event to a panel of judges, with prizes awarded in several categories (see below).

The event will start with a series of practical educational tutorials to get you started with fundamental data analysis with the R programming language, followed by working sessions where teams will explore and analyze the data set in preparation for the team presentations. Participants will work in small teams (2 - 5 people).  Teams can either be pre-arranged by participants themselves, or will be assigned at the start of the event.  

This event is open to data scientists, enthusiasts and hackers of all levels, from the beginner to the highly experienced.  If you are a beginner, it may be helpful to do some preparatory learning before the event — see the suggested resources below.  If you are an experienced user, we look forward to you sharing your expertise with others. Assisting others, both within and between teams, is highly encouraged.

## Goals of the Hackathon

* The hackathon is primarily an *educational* event, not a competition.  However, the hackathon is framed in the context of a light competition to provide overall structure, including team-based collaboration, the presentation of final work, judging, and prizes.
* *Novice Users*: provide an opportunity to work with a real-world data sets from start (acquire the data) to finish (produce a final “report” on the findings from their work).
* *Experienced Users*: provide an opportunity to practice data analysis skills in a structured environment, interact with others, and assist new users.

## Data

This is an open data hackathon. Any and all puplicly avaliable data can be used as long as it adheres to the rules. Listed below is a handful of datasets that provides a good starting point. All of these datasets allong with data dictionaries are located in the data folder in this repository.

### Dataset #1 - Drinking Water Watch - Public Water System Information
[Open Data Format](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-public-water-system-information)

List of Active Public Water Systems (PWS) in California. It includes basic information such as population served, number of connections, county, etc. This data also have a [public portal](https://sdwis.waterboards.ca.gov/PDWW/). 

### Dataset #2 - California Population Projection by County, Age, Gender and Ethnicity

### Dataset #3 - Periodic Groundwater Level Measurements
[Open Data Format](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/periodic-groundwater-level-measurements)

The DWR Periodic Groundwater Levels dataset contains seasonal and long-term groundwater level measurements collected by the Department of Water Resources and cooperating agencies in groundwater basins statewide. It also includes data collected through the CASGEM (California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring) Program. Most measurements are taken manually twice per year to capture the peak high and low values in groundwater elevations. However, the dataset also includes measurements recorded more frequently, monthly, weekly, or daily.

### Dataset #4 - Human Right to Water Regulatory
[Open Data Format](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-human-right-water-regulatory-including-enforcement-actions-information)
