# OCRUG Hackathon 2019

*(2019-04-11) WORK IN PROGRESS: THE INFORMATION BELOW IS TENTATIVE*

## Event Summary

The OCRUG Hackathon 2019, hosted by the [Orange County R Users Group](https://ocrug.org) and the [UCI Paul Merage School of Business](https://merage.uci.edu) is a two day event where we will "hack" a data set for fun, education, and prizes.  The focus of the event is on education and teamwork, with the main goal of taking a data set from its "raw" form all the way through to a final "product" (e.g. visualization, model, insight).  To frame this process, we will have light competitive aspect where teams will present their work at end of the event to a panel of judges, with prizes awarded in several categories (see below).

The event will start with a series of practical educational tutorials to get you started with fundamental data analysis with the R programming language, followed by working sessions where teams will explore and analyze the data set in preparation for the team presentations. Participants will work in small teams (2 - 5 people).  Teams can either be pre-arranged by participants themselves, or will be assigned at the start of the event.  

This event is open to data scientists, enthusiasts and hackers of all levels, from the beginner to the highly experienced.  If you are a beginner, it may be helpful to do some preparatory learning before the event — see the suggested resources below.  If you are an experienced user, we look forward to you sharing your expertise with others. Assisting others, both within and between teams, is highly encouraged.
