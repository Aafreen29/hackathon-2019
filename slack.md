# Slack Channel

A slack channel has been set up for the hackathon. This will be used for general announcements but it is also a great source for you to ask questions to other participants.

If you have not created an account on our slack group, create one using the following link:

Once you have an account, sign in (you can do it on a web browser or download an app on your phone or desktop).
